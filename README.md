<h1>Developer Mindset</h1>

<p> When you have something to implement and you are not sure about the solutions, don’t ask others how to so it …at least not immediately. Instead, try anything and everything you can think of. This is more important the less comfortable you are with a concept or language.

When you can’t think of anything on your own, search! Find answers and try them out. Modify those answers, see if you can understand why they work, adapt them to your code.

<strong>But always seek advice.</strong>
